# 65 Consider the problem of binary classification. Assume I trained a model on a linearly separable 
training set, and now I have a new labeled data point that the model properly categorized and is far 
away from the decision border. In which instances is the learnt decision boundary likely to change if I 
now add this additional point to my previous training set and re-train? When the training model is,
Answer-
# 66 Assume youâ€™ve discovered multi-collinear features. Which of the following actions do you 
intend to take next? (1). Both collinear variables should be removed. (2). Instead of deleting both 
variables, we can simply delete one. (3). Removing correlated variables may result in information 
loss. We may utilize penalized regression models such as ridge or lasso regression to keep such 
variables.
